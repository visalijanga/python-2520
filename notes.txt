============

-> Python : 35-40 Days (Common for DA/DS/AI or FullStack or Cloud & DevOps)

    -> DA/DS/AI : pandas, numpy, matplotlib etc 
    -> FullStack : Django
    -> Cloud & DevOps : Scripting (OS,SYS,Cloud Modules etc)

-> Python : Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
            Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability 
            with the use of significant indentation. 
            Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.

-> Programming Language (Python) : Communicate with Machines

    -> Why shouldn't i Communicate with Machines using English ?

        -> Machines Use Binary Language (01110100101's) 

            -> Binary Language == Machine Language = Low Level Language

            -> 01110000 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101111 01101110 

                -> python

            -> High Level Language 

        Language (English) : Communicate with humans who wants to exchange ideas / data 
        in terms of english
    
    -> General-purpose programming languages

        -> used to manage workloads in different domains 

            -> python can be used for following 
                (bcz of Supporting Multiple Programming Paradigms )

                -> Desktop Apps
                -> Web Apps
                -> API Dev
                -> Data Related Domain
                -> Scripting 
                -> etc 

    -> Domain Specific programming languages

        -> Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in Database Systems

    -> Programming Paradigms 

        -> Paradigm : structure / way to do things

        -> Imperative : HOW TO DO (Style) - Full stack / DevOps / Cloud

        -> Declarative : WHAT TO DO (Style) Functional - DA / DS / AI

        -> Python supports Multiple Programming Paradigms 


    -> Add Two Numbers In Java

    class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {          
            int first = 10;
            int second = 20;
            // add two numbers
            int sum = first + second;
            System.out.println(first + " + " + second + " = "  + sum);
        }
    }

    -> Add Two Numbers In Python
        first = 10
        second = 20
        sum = first + second
        print(sum)

    -> Compiled (Fast In Performance) - Java
